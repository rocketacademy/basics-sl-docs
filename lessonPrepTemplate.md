# Lesson Preparation Template

*Use these questions to guide your preparation of the day's zoom session. Note that not all questions below will be applicable to all topics.*

*Remember to supplement this discussion topic planning with working code examples that you have planned out.*

Use a copy of this document template to plan each of your lessons: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sj25HM0u6IrylFDw5wy_KC3GKjZnBcLpqsiP0Y5FFdM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sj25HM0u6IrylFDw5wy_KC3GKjZnBcLpqsiP0Y5FFdM/edit?usp=sharing)

## Learning Objectives

1. What are the two or three principal learning objectives for this class?
2. What role does this session play within the:
    1. topic
    2. module
    3. course
    4. previous day
    5. next day
3. What impact do you expect the session to have on students’ depth of conceptual knowledge, development of judgment and analytical skills, and application coding abilities?

## Teaching Opportunities and Challenges

1. What compelling topics, points of tension, or potentially surprising or counterintuitive
insights stand out in the topic? How will you leverage these to engage your students in high quality discussion?
2. What in the topic might the students find difficult or confusing? How will you manage the
discussion of these issues?
3. At what points in the discussion is the class at greatest risk of going off-track? How will you
manage such contingencies should they arise?
4. How might you draw upon relevant connections between this class session and your own experience?

## Class Design

***Structure***

1. What issues or pieces of analysis should be covered during the discussion?
2. How will you sequence the discussion topics and how much time should be devoted to
each? What is the logic underlying each transition from one topic to another?
3. How will your plan support the module design and facilitate student learning?

***Opening***

1. What comments, if any, will you make to introduce the discussion? Why?
2. What is the rationale behind your opening question?
3. Which student will you select as the one who demonstrates the code? Why?
4. How do you expect the discussion to emerge following the opener’s initial response?

***Discussion Leadership***

1. What follow-up questions within each topic will motivate students to think beyond the
sample code?
2. How will you phrase the transition between each topic?
3. What question will you use to introduce each topic following the opening discussion?
4. Could you incorporate student backgrounds into the discussion? Are there specific
students who should/should not be encouraged to contribute during particular topic?
5. How might you stimulate students to think beyond this session and develop insights through
linkages across classes, modules, and courses?

***Closing***

1. How do you plan to close the class discussion? Why?
2. What are the risks of providing too much closure at the end of this class? Too little?
