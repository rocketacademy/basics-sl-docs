# Rocket Academy Basics: SL Guide
Rocket Academy is committed to providing all of its students a great learning experience.

Here we’ll outline some principles and guidelines to facilitate a great experience for every student.
## What is teaching? Why are we teaching?
The process of learning a new concept or skill happens 90% due to the work and motivation of each student. We as instructors are here to facilitate the experience of each student and guide them through the process of discovering for themselves the ideas and concepts implicit in the field of coding. We are here to provide the space and opportunity to practice the skill of coding.

Rocket believes that for coding, learning happens in two main ways: When students are given the framework and context of a project based approach to the subject, and when they have an opportunity to practice these skills and concepts in collaboration with their peers.

It is our job to assist the student in their journey through the program.

Rocket believes that in the process of learning correctly memorized answers are less important than connecting together concepts and ideas and applying them to working projects.
## Why are the students here?
In all education, but particularly in adult education, each student comes with their own unique background and experiences, and therefore also comes with a wide range of possible motives and intentions for learning the material.

We are here to support those intentions as much as we can in relation to the material we are covering. There are no dumb questions and there are no questions that are out of the scope of the course. If at all possible we should encourage students to connect what they are doing to other fields that they are familiar with. The course itself has an intentionally limited scope, but no student is wrong for wanting to focus more on the syntax details of JavaScript (e.g., operator precedence), nor is a student “less good” if they are uninterested in such details.
## How to guide someone
Rocket believes in a non-didactic style of teaching. The role of an instructor is not to tell the student what they are doing wrong, or to correct a student if they say something incorrect.

We believe an instructor’s role is to make sure that the student is on the right track and has all the necessary tools to complete the current task.

The point of any discussion should be, first and foremost, to move the student forward in the code or concept while making factually correct statements (technical completeness of a given statement is, however, not too important). The answers to a question should keep in mind such things as, what is the student trying to accomplish? What is the deeper context of their question? 

Use these tips to help guide your discussions with students. Not all possible teaching topics are covered in these few tips, but they should give an overall picture of what a discussion with a student should feel like.
**It’s not important to be “correct” all the time:** Any misconception the student has regarding their code or the current examples or concepts can be discussed in depth. However, if there is a tangential concept or misconception that doesn’t relate to the current project or adjacent projects then it can be left off. This is up to the discretion of each instructor, but remember that the point of facilitating a discussion does not need to be that each statement by the student is 100% correct.

**Show don’t tell:** demonstration of code concepts is always preferable and will always be easier for the student to understand than discussing verbally. Have VSCode and/or Chrome setup properly so that you can easily show the student what you are discussing.

**Ask leading questions:** when you want to tell the student the answer to some problem or question, it may be that they have not grasped all the sub-parts of what is being asked. Always try to lead them to the answer by asking questions that are relevant to their understanding. Make sure to ask check-in questions to the student to make sure they are on the same page with you in the discussion. Avoid talking continuously for many minutes without asking a specific clarifying question.

**Don’t debug their code:** when working with a student who has an unknown bug in their code don’t try to solve their problem. First and foremost, most students have not yet mastered the *process* of debugging their code. Rather than the stressful situation of having to work ahead of them and solve their problem before them, take a fresh look at all of their code together. Have them explain what their code does and have them write console logs for the places that will help everyone see where the error is coming from.

It is not the instructor's job to fix the student's code. It is the instructor's job to guide the student in the process of learning how to debug their own code.

## Encourage the Students to Ask Questions
One of the main tasks of the instructor is to encourage students to ask questions.

Students can feel disincentivized to ask questions because of previous experiences being in classroom settings where it was not acceptable to ask questions that may be perceived as inappropriate or demonstrating lack of knowledge, or the students may simply feel shy about voicing any questions in front of their peers, or may simply be hesitant to take up the time of the instructor. These tendencies can be exacerbated in an online environment which can seem less personal and more intimidating.

In Rocket's remote-first structure, motivating the students to raise their questions in a clear and timely manner is a key to their success in the program. In a traditional physical classroom environment it can be left up to the instructor to interpret which student is behind or if a student looks confused. However, in an online / remote environment it is crucial that students feel empowered to raise whatever questions they have at any time because it is so much more difficult for the instructor to intuit how the student is doing.

This practice of encouraging students' questions is relevant across every modality of the program: questions during group zoom discussions, questions during the pair programming, questions when stuck on solo work.

**Questions raised on zoom**

To make sure that students feel comfortable asking questions in real time: Try not to dismiss a question out of hand. If a question is difficult to answer or out of the scope of the current discussion, say that you will answer it in a slack message to the whole class later. Make sure that every question is addressed in some way, even if it is totally irrelevant. Don't use any language that might be interpreted as discouraging "bad" questions.

**Questions raised in slack**

If a Slack question is unclear, use a thread to ask clarifying questions.

Unless of a specific personal nature, don't address questions in DM messages in Slack. Always ask to move the question into the group.

**Any question is better than no questions**

One meta-aspect of the learning outcomes of the program is training the students to ask good questions. This may not be easy and is something that improves with practice. Encourage students to ask questions even if they struggle to formulate it or it comes out as 'I don't know about arrays'. After getting an unclear question it is the instructors job to ask clarifying questions until the exact nature of the student's question is clear. Try to repeat back the final, clarified version of the question.

## Things not to do
Please follow the social rules guidelines set out in the basics Gitbook. Especially in the instructor-student dynamic it’s important to remember that patience is key, and that a student won’t remember every aspect of a topic, or may even forget topics that have already been covered. No one is wrong because they have not retained all of the topics covered in the course. If a student seems very behind in ability or knowledge within the course schedule, this can be discussed outside of class time.

## Common Student FAQ

**Q: But what does this actually mean?**

A: The student has some more fundamental question about the topic being covered. Sometimes students want to know more about first principles of a topic, but this is out of the scope of the course, e.g., "What really is a variable? How does it work?". Save this question to be posted in the slack or ask the student to do it. Also remind the student that the important concepts we'll be learning will all have applications in what we're building and it will be easy to talk about "What is an array" in the context of what we are trying to accomplish.

**Q: How would this be used in the real world?**

A: A section leader may not have enough context to answer this question, and it could be appropriate to put in slack. However the general answer to this question is that our "toy" Basics programs are actually reasonably close to a "real" program, in that data in a real program works the same way, and processing of data and logic for that data is constructed in a very similar way. Of course, explain to the student that someone would not create a Blackjack game this way.
