The **Start and End Dates** are consequential, but the specific recurring times are not, as participants are **allowed to join anytime** between the Start and End Dates. You can also check **“recurring”** and **“No Fixed Time”** in the drop down menu.

## Make a TinyURL Link for your Recurring Meeting

1. Copy your meeting invite URL from the Zoom dashboard
2. Go to [tinyurl.com](http://tinyurl.com) and make a short link for your Zoom room with the format tinyurl.com/basics-<BATCH_NUM>-<SECTION_NUM>-zoom, e.g. tinyurl.com/basics-9-6-zoom.
3. Add this short link prominently in your section channel in Slack, e.g. as the topic or description so it's easy for your section to find and click.
