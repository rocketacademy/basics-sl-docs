# Day 10: Project Presentations

## Overview

This is the last class meeting!

Time may be a little tight, so give students about 3 to 5 minutes per presentation (depending on section size). Students can be encouraged to structure their presentations in the following manner:

* A demo of their Blackjack project
* What are they the most proud of achieving for this project (or this course)?
* Given more time on this project, what other new features will they add?

After their presentations, they will be voting on the Most Creative project of the section. As SLs, we get to nominate the student who is the Most Improved!

The main Zoom room will be getting prepared for the Closing Ceremony. In the meantime, students can embark on post-course feedback and reviews while waiting for the main Zoom room. You can also use the time while waiting on their feedback to generate LinkedIn certificates for them.

In the last half an hour of the class, students will move to the main Zoom room for the Closing Ceremony. The Most Creative project winners per section will be presenting their projects again to the larger Basics batch.

## Class Schedule

This is a mock class schedule for the day, based on an older Basics schedule. The exact timings may not be followed depending on changes in schedule, but it can be used for SLs to structure their class time.
